# Destiny-2-Hub-App

## Overview 

The Destiny 2 Hub App will allow players to swap gear, weapons, and materials between their characters and vault, while allowing the creation of loadouts. Sorting gear in the vault based on power, rarity, and number of items will also let players organize their gear how they see fit. With a simple and sleek UI/UX, users can change, sort, and manage their gear with ease and create a loadout without having to keep swapping over gear. 

## Loadouts

The main difference between other destiny inventory apps and this one is the option of loadouts. Each character will have the option to create 3 loadouts taking into account weapons, gear, mods, and subclass. The user also has the option to name their loadout for better description of what that specific build is i.e PvE, Rusher, Defense. 

## UI/UX

The app's UI/UX is similar to how most destiny inventory apps work with the exception or a more organized and simpler to see interface.
